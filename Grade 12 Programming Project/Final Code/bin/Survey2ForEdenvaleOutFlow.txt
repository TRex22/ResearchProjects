The water is clear on top with lots of sediment at the bottom. The river bed also has black streaks of algae. 
Solids Collected in the Net:
Seaweed like substance, some form of fresh water algae.
Amount of Visible sediment in the water
Lots of sediment deposition, braiding occurring and a sand spit/bar has been produced. 
The sediment consists out of small stones and clumps with large rocks deposited onto the bed and being weathered down. 
Infiltration rate of soil at test site
20.58 Seconds
Height of tallest vegetation in the area
15M – 20M
Basal Cover in near vicinity (per M):
5 Strikes


Fauna/ flora in the immediate vicinity:
Found blood worms, rats, ticks and birds in the local vicinity. 
There is also algae in the river, black wattle trees, willows, Kikuyu grass and eucalyptus trees. 
Note of human encroachment in the area:
There is evidence of sewage pipes in the river, concrete tubing,  
slight pollution and a road which flows over the river and therefore changes the flow of the river due to the 
bridge which chokes the embankment of the river at that point,  making the water ‘bunch up’ and flow out at a greater pace.
