Site 1 

Bruma Lake
Field Survey:
Odour of Water:
The odour is much better than at site 1. There is still a slightly disgusting odour but it is barely noticeable. This is probably due to municipal involvement to increase the water quality in the Bruma Lake.
Colour of Water:
Clear with black heavy silt deposited at the bottom on the lake.
Solids Collected in the Net:
There is a half decomposed leaf in the net.
Amount of Visible sediment in the water
There is lots of black sediment deposed at the bottom of the lake due to the speed of the water being slowed down and the bad construction of the lake and its dam wall.
Infiltration rate of soil at test site
7.37 Seconds
Height of tallest vegetation in the area
Low ~5CM due to being built up along the banks of the river
Basal Cover in near vicinity (per M):
12 Strikes
Fauna/ flora in the immediate vicinity:
There are worms in the soil along the embankments, there are a few fish and duck in the lake. There is artificially planted kikuyu grass along the embankment and several weeds and I even noticed a broad-leaf lily.
Note of human encroachment in the area:
There are discarded boats in the near vicinity, small paving around the embankment, a place where a fire had burned and some old burned rubber tyres. There was also some garbage stuck to the bottom of the lake.
