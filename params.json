{"name":"ResearchProjects","tagline":"A repo of all my old Research Projects. From High School and University","body":"ResearchProjects\r\n================\r\nAfter watching the TED talk \"Two young scientists break down plastics with bacteria\"\r\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay-y3tSYGYw\r\n\r\nI could relate to their project in the fact that I did my own river research study.\r\nIt was not on the same scope, having the same support or as good as what they did\r\nbut I thought that perhaps I should provide a place to my research in case someone\r\nelse would want a jumpboard for their own research.\r\n\r\nMy earlier work will not be as refined as later work.\r\nA lot of reports probably won't be formatted 'correctly' and may contain spelling\r\nmistakes. I tend to do a lot of back-end work and then at the end when I'm \r\nexhausted I put it together. I know thats bad and I'm working on it.\r\n\r\nI have thought of including the histories and indiviual files to these projects,\r\nand in some cases I will but some will only be the final pdf. That is because\r\neither I have lost data, or the components when looked at objectively, becomes\r\nsort of abstract and not realy in the scope of the final document - where I put\r\nall the good bits and stuff (I know words escape me).\r\n\r\nThis idea is to put my work, good, bad and ungly out there so that it is seen.\r\nI don't like doing something for an arbituary and useless value (mark) and then\r\nforget about it and never again look back. \r\n\r\nI have another repository for all my old code. It is on a similar vein as this one.\r\nhttps://github.com/TRex22/OldCodeArchive\r\n\r\nThe whole repository is protected under the MIT license. The research I have done\r\nwith others, the MIT license will extend to them.\r\n\r\nProjects\r\n========\r\nHere is some documentation for the projects in this repo.\r\n\r\nRiverPollutionResearchProject\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is my highschool science research project. \r\nIt is a river study on a river which flows from the heart of the city I live in,\r\nJohannesburg and through the suburbs (Where I live) and into townships. That was\r\nthe scope of my research.\r\n\r\nThe expermental theory may not be as emperical as I would like it to be today,\r\nbut at the time I had never done anything on the scope, level or intensity.\r\nI also did not have the support or access to tools required to properly analyse\r\nsamples. I used sight identification and water/medical testing strips.\r\nI was lucky to have access to highly skilled and educated teachers, such as\r\nthe bilogy teacher who helped to identify plant species. And the one Information\r\nTechnology teacher who helped me to analyse the computer data.\r\n\r\nThe link to the final pdf is: http://trex22.github.io/ResearchProjects/Geography%20Research%20Assignment%20FINAL%201.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nElevator Project\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nTODO add more content here. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ BOO!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
